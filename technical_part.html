									<h3>Big Data - The place of sport in french society</h3>
									<h5>Presentation</h5>
									<p>With the multiplication of datas due, inter alia, to IoT, we followed a module of Data Analysis where we first learned to use R which is a programming language for statistical computing and data analysis in order to extract useful datas from enormous datasets. Then, we had a mini-project to apply our new skills: we had to chose an open dataset and lead an analysis on it and summarize it in a report. With <a href="http://www.mathieu-raynaud.com/portfolio">Mathieu Raynaud</a>, we chosed to work on the place of sport in the french society. </p>
									<h5>Resolution of the problem</h5>
									<p> To determine the place of sport in the french society, we tried to see if the investment, the life expectancy, the migratory tendencies were impacted by the number of sportive equipment per inhabitant.
									To do so, we analyzed four open data sets, two from the french government (<a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/">data.gouv.fr</a>) and two from the french national institute of statistic and economic studies (<a href="https://www.insee.fr/fr/accueil">INSEE</a>).
									Finally, we analyzed these data sets using the programming language R. You can access the GitHub repository in which we stored all the produced algorithms by clicking the button below:</p>

												</ul>
									</div>
									<h5>Knowledge and skills mobilized</h5>
									<p>We used the skills we have developed in R and our analysis skills.</p>
									<h5>Summary and review</h5>
									<p>That training gave us a first experience in data science and a better understanding of data exploration. I liked that we could freely chose the subject of our mni-project. All of our work was consigned in the following report:</p>

									<h3>Sigfox Network Study</h3>
									<h5>Presentation</h5>
									<p>
									During the protocols training, we had to produce a report and a presentation on the main communication protocols used in IoT such as Sigfox, NB-IoT, LoRa, Bluetooth Low Energy and Zigbee. 
									With Julien Chouvet, we worked on the Sigfox protocol and more particularly on its network architecture, its protocol stack, its power consumption and the available security implementation. </p>
									<h5>Resolution of the problem</h5>
									<p>During this work, we had to lead literature search and synthesis. The most challenging part was to find reliable sources. The power consumption part was also quite challengin because it was hard to give a global answer so we made the choixe to carry a case study with a typical Sigfox transceiver. </p>
									<h5>Knowledge and skills mobilized</h5>
									<p>The skill we used the most during this work was clearly our critical thinking. As most of our sources were from Sigfox itself we had to sort the informations whether they were reliable or not. Moreover, wee had to use our background skills in several fields to have a critical look on the informations we found.  </p>
									<h5>Summary and review</h5>
									<p> It was interesting to compare the differents technologies with the others students. Moreover, we are now able to chose the right protocol regarding the applications as we know the strenghts and weaknesses of the diffrent IoT protocols.<br>
									You can find our report and presentation below:</p>

									<h3>MAC Layers for Wireless Sensor Network</h3>
									<h5>Presentation</h5>
									<p> During the protocols training, we had to produce a report on the exisiting MAC Layers and more specifically the ones designed for Wireless Sensor Network. It's an important component of these network cause it has impact at different levels of the system such as power consumption, mobility, QoS, ... </p>
									<h5>Resolution of the problem</h5>
									<p> During my researches, I found the main techniques of media access control such as FDMA, TDMA and CD/CSMA but also MAC layer specifically design for IoT like S-MAC, T-MAC, B-MAC and Z-MAC. Most of this techniques are state-of-the-art and so are exposed in research papers which I had to dig through.</p>
									<h5>Knowledge and skills mobilized</h5>
									<p>I found that exercice quite challenging and time-consuming as I had to dive into research paper in a field where i'm not an expert. Indeed, it is a very popular research field and so it is very dense and it was quite difficult to grasp the essence of the research papers I read. However, I, now, have a better understanding of the principal MAC layers. </p>
									<h5>Summary and review</h5>
									<p> You can find my report below:  </p>
