									<h3>Big Data - The place of sport in french society</h3>
									<h5>Presentation</h5>
									<p>With the multiplication of datas due, inter alia, to IoT, we followed a module of Data Analysis where we first learned to use R which is a programming language for statistical computing and data analysis in order to extract useful datas from enormous datasets. Then, we had a mini-project to apply our new skills: we had to chose an open dataset and lead an analysis on it and summarize it in a report. With <a href="http://www.mathieu-raynaud.com/portfolio">Mathieu Raynaud</a>, we chosed to work on the place of sport in the french society. </p>
									<h5>Resolution of the problem</h5>
									<p> To determine the place of sport in the french society, we tried to see if the investment, the life expectancy, the migratory tendencies were impacted by the number of sportive equipment per inhabitant.
									To do so, we analyzed four open data sets, two from the french government (<a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/">data.gouv.fr</a>) and two from the french national institute of statistic and economic studies (<a href="https://www.insee.fr/fr/accueil">INSEE</a>).
									Finally, we analyzed these data sets using the programming language R. You can access the GitHub repository in which we stored all the produced algorithms by clicking the button below:</p>

												</ul>
									</div>
									<h5>Knowledge and skills mobilized</h5>
									<p>We used the skills we have developed in R and our analysis skills.</p>
									<h5>Summary and review</h5>
									<p>That training gave us a first experience in data science and a better understanding of data exploration. I liked that we could freely chose the subject of our mni-project. All of our work was consigned in the following report:</p>

									<h3>Sigfox Network Study</h3>
									<h5>Presentation</h5>
									<p>
									During the protocols training, we had to produce a report and a presentation on the main communication protocols used in IoT such as Sigfox, NB-IoT, LoRa, Bluetooth Low Energy and Zigbee. 
									With Julien Chouvet, we worked on the Sigfox protocol and more particularly on its network architecture, its protocol stack, its power consumption and the available security implementation. </p>
									<h5>Resolution of the problem</h5>
									<p>During this work, we had to lead literature search and synthesis. The most challenging part was to find reliable sources. The power consumption part was also quite challengin because it was hard to give a global answer so we made the choixe to carry a case study with a typical Sigfox transceiver. </p>
									<h5>Knowledge and skills mobilized</h5>
									<p>The skill we used the most during this work was clearly our critical thinking. As most of our sources were from Sigfox itself we had to sort the informations whether they were reliable or not. Moreover, wee had to use our background skills in several fields to have a critical look on the informations we found.  </p>
									<h5>Summary and review</h5>
									<p> It was interesting to compare the differents technologies with the others students. Moreover, we are now able to chose the right protocol regarding the applications as we know the strenghts and weaknesses of the diffrent IoT protocols.<br>
									You can find our report and presentation below:</p>

									<h3>MAC Layers for Wireless Sensor Network</h3>
									<h5>Presentation</h5>
									<p> During the protocols training, we had to produce a report on the exisiting MAC Layers and more specifically the ones designed for Wireless Sensor Network. It's an important component of these network cause it has impact at different levels of the system such as power consumption, mobility, QoS, ... </p>
									<h5>Resolution of the problem</h5>
									<p> During my researches, I found the main techniques of media access control such as FDMA, TDMA and CD/CSMA but also MAC layer specifically design for IoT like S-MAC, T-MAC, B-MAC and Z-MAC. Most of this techniques are state-of-the-art and so are exposed in research papers which I had to dig through.</p>
									<h5>Knowledge and skills mobilized</h5>
									<p>I found that exercice quite challenging and time-consuming as I had to dive into research paper in a field where i'm not an expert. Indeed, it is a very popular research field and so it is very dense and it was quite difficult to grasp the essence of the research papers I read. However, I, now, have a better understanding of the principal MAC layers. </p>
									<h5>Summary and review</h5>
									<p> You can find my report below:  </p>

									<h3>Wireless Communication - Interferences case study</h3>
									<h5>Presentation</h5>
									<p>During this training, we studied wireless communications at different levels. We learned about the different communication protocols dedicated to IoT applications. Thanks to these lectures, we, now, have a better understanding of the IoT ecosystem and its whys and wherefores. In order to applicate our new skills, we had to answer to a case study in project group about Zigbee interferences.</p>
									<h5>Resolution of the problem</h5>
									<p>I had never worked on telecommunications before this lecture, so it was quite challenging for me but we managed to do the expected work as a team. To do so, we really had to dive into the mathematical model, and we applied the wave propagation equation and the Friis law to etablish our link budget.</p>
									<h5>Knowledge and skills mobilized</h5>
									<p>During this lecture, I used a bit my background knowledge in radio communications but i really developped skills and acquired knowledge in wireless communication, how to design and size a link.</p>
									<h5>Summary and review</h5>
									<p>You can find my below report :</p>

									<h3>Software Defined Radio</h3>
									<h5>Presentation</h5>
									<p> During the communication course, we had labs about signal defined radio in which we worked on practical applications of wireless communications for Radio and VOLMET messages. In SDR, most of the signal processing is done by software, for this lab, we used GNU Radio. Thanks to this, it's easier to update the system without changing any hardware part and to implement new functionalities. In order to do so, we need to have a receiver that can handle many protocols and a large bandwith, so we use a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP). I worked with Mathieu Raynaud during this project.  
									</p>
									<h5>Resolution of the problem</h5>
									<p>
									Firstly, we did some theoritical work about the IQ modulator, we worked on the mathematical aspect to prove that we could correctly modulate and demodulate signals thanks to this modulator. Then, we moved on the partical part, where we first demodulate radio signals. Thanks to GNU Radio and its various signal processing functions, we could switch between stations and even demodulate in real-time using an USRP. In a second time, we worked on the demodulation of VOLMET messages which is not the same as radio, we implemented our demodulator thanks to GNU radio and it worked with a recording but when we tried to do real-time demodulation, it did not work because our USRP did not cover this bandwith. We, then, summarized our work in a report you can find below. 
									</p>
									<h5>Knowledge and skills mobilized</h5>
									<p>For these labs, I mobilized my background skills in signal processing and the skills in telecommunications that I had developped throughout all the Communication course.</p>
									<h5>Summary and review</h5>
									<p>You can find below my report :

									<h3>Iridium Next Presentation</h3>
									<h5>Presentation</h5>
									<p>During the course of Communication, students made several presentations about the emerging networks such as 5G. Thanks to these technologies, we will soon have faster and more reliable wireless communciations. These presentations were an opening to these innovations and their aftermath.</p>
									<h5>Resolution of the problem</h5>
									<p> As I said, the course was a set of students made presentation that where presenting emerging technologies about communication in IoT. With our group, we focused the Iridium Next satellites constellation. We tried to present what is Iridium Next, in what purposes it is going to be deployed and how is it working in a global view. </p>
									<h5>Knowledge and skills mobilized</h5>
									<p>I made some reasearches for this course, so I used my analytical and synthesis skills as well as my commmunication skills during the presentation.</p>
									<h5>Summary and review</h5>
									<p>You can find below our presentation:</p>

									<h3>OM2M Labs</h3>
									<h5>Presentation</h5>
									<p>During this course, we learned how to deploy advanced architecyure for IoT. We applied one of the standard of IoT that is designed for Machine-to-Machine communication and permits interoperability: oneM2M. We first had a MOOC about OM2M which is the Eclipse implementation of the oneM2M standard. Thanks to this course and the labs we could used the OM2M middleware with different technologies and made them interoperable. I worked with Mathieu Raynaud during this course. </p>
									<h5>Resolution of the problem</h5>
									<p> During these labs, we, firstly, learned to use OM2M by deploying simple architectures. Then, we learned how to interface new devices with their protocols to the existing architecture thanks to an Interworking Proxy Entity. We also used a REST Client to intercat with our achitecture. Finally, we deployed a composite architecture with a Phillips HUE Lamp and Fibaro multi-sensor and built simple applications using Node-RED.  </p>
									<h5>Knowledge and skills mobilized</h5>
									<p>In this course, I developed skills about middlewares and how to interface different technologies. </p>
									<h5>Summary and review</h5>
									<p>You can find below our report:</p>

									<h3>Room autonomic management project</h3>
									<h5>Presentation</h5>
									<p>During this course, we saw many concepts about Service Oriented Architecture. SOA is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network.	During the tutorials, we implemented services using SOAP and REST. The aim of this project was ti develop a Room Autonomic management application using this concepts. I worked with Mathieu Raynaud and Erwan Béguin for this project.	</p>
									<h5>Resolution of the problem</h5>
									<p>Our project was compposed of three parts: we had a OM2M ressource tree that was simulating all our sensors and actuators, a Node-RED application with a dashboard where all our scenarii were implemented and where we could display our data in a user-friendly way as well as simulating updating the values of our simulated sensors and, finally, a REST API that immplemented the needed services to interact with our OM2M architecture. This is summarized in the figure below:

									<h3>Cloud and autonomic management labs</h3>
									<h5>Presentation</h5>
									<p>During this course, we saw the main concepts about cloud, autonomic management and virtualization techniques. We, then, applied these concepts in several labs in order to develop an autonomic ressources management applications.  During these labs I worked with Laurent Chasserat.</p>
									<h5>Resolution of the problem</h5>
									<p>The first lab was mainly a theoretical approach about virtualization, and a discovery of the main techniques. The following labs were aiming at balancing the computation load of containers over several servers. We controlled the Proxmox virtualization platform with a Rest API thanks to a Java application. You may learn much more about these labs in the report below. </p>
									<h5>Knowledge and skills mobilized</h5>
									<p>During this course, I used my skills in Java and learned a lot about the diffrents virtualization techniques and the autonomic management.</p>

									<h3>Social psychology</h3>
									<h5>Presentation</h5>
									<p>During this course, we saw the main social psychology concepts that we could encountered in a work situation. We saw different problematic that we applied to our innovative project. For this course, I worked with Waël Ben Jemaa and Jean-Baptiste Laffosse. </p>
									<h5>Resolution of the problem</h5>
									<p>The psychology concepts were presented by students and, in a second time, we did and present an ethical case study applied to our innovative project. Our group presented the conflict management and decision-making. We then did a case study about an ecological issue with our innovative project. We also had to present our most important values as engineers and manager.<br>
									This course really forced us to take a step back and to think about what are our real life objectives in a working point of view.
									
									</p>
									<h5>Knowledge and skills mobilized</h5>
									<p>During this course, I used my skills in Human Science as well as my presentation skills.</p>
